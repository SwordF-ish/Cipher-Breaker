Code Running Instructions:

Classical:
simply execute the main.py file. It contains all the necessary code to execute all others. 
NOTE: We used GPT4o's API (OpenAI Langchain), so might need a premium subscription. Fee free to use any other API. Results may vary

RSA:
Run the Data_create.ipynb file first to create a dataset. Takes <3s. Then Run the rsa.ipynb. No need to train (unless you want to) as finetune.txt is already saved.

Thank you.
