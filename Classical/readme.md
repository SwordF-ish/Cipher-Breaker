# Cipher Whisperer

## Overview

Cipher Whisperer is a software project that aims to decrypt and analyze cipher texts using a graph-based approach. The project utilizes various software libraries and tools to process and transform the input text.

Graph Architecture:

The system takes in a text, extracts a single cipher text block from it and detects what suspected ciphers it matches with a probability of above 70% confidence level. Lastly the system calls the respective decryptors on the cipher text in an attempt to decrypt it correctly. 

## Software and Libraries Used

* Python 3 as the primary programming language
* `dotenv` for environment variable management
* `langgraph` for graph-based processing and transformation
* `langchain_core` and `langchain_openai` for natural language processing and AI-powered decryption
* `pydantic` for data validation and parsing

## Decryptors

The project features a range of decryptors, including:

* BruteForceDecryptor: a brute-force decryptor that uses a list of English words to decrypt the follow ciphers: Caesar, Atbash, Affine, Bacon, Transposition
* Other decryptors (to be added in future updates)

Sample run:

Future work include:

* Adding a reflection component to the system that analyzes the output after the first run and tries again.
* Adding the ability to extract multiple cipher text blocks from a given text.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3
* Required libraries: `dotenv`, `langgraph`, `langchain_core`, `langchain_openai`, `pydantic`

### Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Create a virtual environment.
3. Install the required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Create a `.env` file with your environment variables (i.e. API keys) following the `.env.example` file

### Running the Code

1. Run the main script: `python main.py`
2. Follow the prompts to input a cipher text and receive the decrypted output

## Project Structure

* `cipherwhisperer/`: main project directory
	+ `main.py`: entry point for the project
	+ `graph.py`: graph-based processing and transformation of input text
	+ `chains.py`: chain-based processing and transformation of input text
	+ `models.py`: data models for the project (e.g. `GraphState`)
	+ `decryptors.py`: decryptor implementations (e.g. BruteForceDecryptor)
	+ `.gitignore`: ignore file for Git
